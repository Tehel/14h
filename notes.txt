Usage
	- conductor creates a "play", selecting music and sound font (optional)
	- conductor generates a QR code with the URL for performers
	- performers scan, and are directed to the client.
	- conductor has a count of connected performers. Starts the play when enough.
	- each performer is assigned a channel (or track ? or notes ? or subset of any), and downloads its part and sample(s), signals he's ready
	- conductor has a visual of readiness. Starts the play (can also pause/stop it).

	Client is a nearly empty screen with a color pulsing when playing notes. Maybe minimal info with instruments assigned.
	Music name can be displayed, if conductor allows (fun to guess what is playing)
